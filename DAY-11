   //OOOPS//
class: virtual entity blueprint of a object,contains abstract and non abtsract methods.
object:instance of a class
to call non static methods which were present in the particular class,we have to create object for particular class
if it static method we directly calling class
constructor : deflt,parametrised constructor
dflt constructor is for every class dflt constructor.  parametrised is we have to pass values or args.
it is neither class or nor method ,its having class name and method properties

INHERITANCE:>>
    SINGLE,MULTILEVEL,MULTIPLE,HIERARCHY
SINGLE :  PROPERTIES ARE INHERITED TO CHILD CLASS FROM PARENT CLASS
MULTILEVEL :PROPERTIES ARE INHERITED TO PARENT CLASS FROM GRAND PARENT CLASS AND INHERITED TO CHILD CLASS TO PARENT CLASS
MULTIPLE :INHERITED TO CHILD CLASS FROM MULTIPLE PARENTS
HIERARCHY: PROPERIES INHERITED TO MULTIPLE CHILDS
EXTEND KEY WORD IS INHERIT THE PROPERTIES FROM CLASSES
IMPLEMENT KEYWORD IS USED TO INHERIT THE PROPERTIES FROM INTERFACES

POLYMORPHISM:>>
      SAME METHOD MULTIPLE TIMES WITH DIFFERENT FORMS
      1.METHOD OVERLOADING 2.METHOD OVERRIDING
1.SAME METHOD NAME IN SAME CLASS WITH DIFF PARAMETERS
2.  METHOD DECLARE WITH CHILD CLASS AND SSAME METHOD EXISISTING  IN PARENT CLASS(SAME NAME,SAME PARAMETERS)
     MAIN METHOD CAN BE OVERRIDEN 

ENCAPSULATION>>
   BINDING METHOD AND DATA AND HIDE SENSITIVE DATA.IF PVT.VARIABLE DECLARE IN CLASS IF WE WANT ACCESS FROM OUTSIDE WE CCANT ACCESS,IF WE WAANT USING METHODS WE CAN.

ABSTRACTION:
    HIDDING IMPLEMENTATION AND SHOWING USEFUL DATA.IF WE METHOD IS ABSTRACT METHOD THE METHOD NAME STAART WITH ABSTARCT KEYWORD
    AS WELL  AS CLASS NAME START WITH ABSTARCT KEYWORD
     4 TYPES:  DATA,FUNCTIONAL,CONTROL AND PROCEDURE
INTERFACE:
          CONTAINS ONLY ABSRACT METHODS WE CANT CREATE OBJECT FOR INTERRFACE
ACCESS SPECIFIERS>>
PUBLIC,PVT,PROTECTED,DFLT
PUBLIC:IF A VARIABLE,METHOD,CLASS THE SCOPE WILL BE WITH IN THE CLASS,IN FILE ,IN PACKAGES,OUTSIDE THE PACKAGE PARENT CLASS IN OUTSIDE THE PACKAGE,CHILD CLASS OF OUTSIDE OF PACKAGE
PRIVATE:IF VARIABLE,METHOD DECLARED AS CLASS THE SCOPE WITH IN THE CLASS ONLY
PROTECTED :IFF A VARIABLE DECLARED AS PROTECTED THE SCOPE WILL BE WHICH I THE CLASS,IN FILE ,PACKAGE ,OUTSIDE THE PACKAGE CHILD CLASSES ONLY.
DFLT:WITH IN CLASS,FILE,PACKAGE.
