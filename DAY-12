   //DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGO//

customization:keep the code efficient,not messy,clean code.so it will be optimised and time taken is very less.
using data structures some times we fail to solve problem in optimsed way,in that time algorithms came in to picture this is called DSA
Linked list,stack,queue,heaps,tree,graph  and algos:2ptrs,kadanes algo,sliding window,greedy,sort,search,backtracking,dp,bfs,dfs


//TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY//
Ignore small values
ignore constants
focus on worst case
for every problem we focus on worst case and the steps for problem
1.Brute force appraoch
2.better(AVG)
3.best case(optimal)

//space complexity//
the extra space using to solve a problem
examples: browser,gmaps.
type of D.S: Linear and non linear
Linear :Linked list,stack and queue
Non-linear : Tress,graph,heaps
social media and browser:Linked list in browwser and social media mutual frnds are used by no linear is graphs
